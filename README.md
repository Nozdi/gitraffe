Gitraffe
========

Gitraffe is a git GUI based on Python and QT for UNIX-like systems (BSD / Linux / Mac OS X). Sounds unoriginal? Well, we are dissatisfied with existing GUIs - in most of them we see things that we don't like and maybe we will provide better solutions, hope so. ;)

How to run Gitraffe?
====================

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.2, PyQT4 for Py 3.2 and Python Setuptools. If you're not sure, see the next section.
2. Go to gitraffe/libraries/ directory and do as root:
easy_install-3.2 pexpect_u-2.5.1-py3.2.egg
3. Just run gitraffe/main.py :)

Which packages do you need?
===========================

Ubuntu
- python3
- python3-pyqt4
- python3-setuptools

Mac OS X (MacPorts)
- python32
- py32-pyqt4
