Gitraffe
========

Gitraffe will be a git GUI based on Python and QT. Sounds unoriginal? Well, we are dissatisfied with existing GUIs - in most of them we see things that we don't like and maybe we will provide better solutions, hope so. ;)

How to run Gitraffe?
====================

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.2 and PyQT4 for Py 3.2.
2. Go to gitraffe/libraries/ directory and do as root:
easy_install pexpect_u-2.5.1-py3.2.egg
3. Just run gitraffe/main.py :)
